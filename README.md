# Project Name
Weekend SQL To-Do App


## Description
This is a full-stack web application that allows users to keep track of various tasks they need to do. Users are required to input the name of the task, they can choose to enter a due date or leave it blank. After a task is added to the list, that task is stored in a database and also displayed on the DOM. Users are able to mark an item as complete and/or delete it. Both of these actions will update that task on the database. 


## Duration
Several days of work over a 3 week period.


## Prerequisities
- Node.js
- React
- SQL
- Postico
- Postgres
- Axios


## Installation
1. Create a database called "weekend-to-do-app"
2. The queries in the database.sql file are ready to create and populate a table needed for this project. This project is built on Postgres so users will need to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries.
3. Open your editor of choice and run "npm install"
4. In your terminal, run "npm run server"
5. On a different tab in your terminal, run "npm run client", this should open the webpage in your browser automatically.


## Usage
1. Type in a task name (required) and a date (optional)
2. Click the "submit" button or press enter on your keyboard
3. If you have completed a task, you can choose to "mark as complete" or "delete" that tasks
4. Tasks, on default, will display a reddish color to signify they are incomplete. Once marked complete, tasks will turn green.
4. That's it! 


## Built With
- Node.js
- Axios
- React
- Postgres
- Postico
